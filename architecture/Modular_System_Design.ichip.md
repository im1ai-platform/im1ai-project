# ðŸ§  Modular System Design â€“ iChip Architecture

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Author:** Don Way  
**File Type:** .ichip.md  
**Purpose:** Define how the im1ai.ca platform is structured using modular architecture for scalability, independence, and clarity.

---

## 1. Problem

How can a complex AI-driven platform remain flexible, evolvable, and understandable â€” both to humans and AI assistants â€” while growing?

---

## 2. Principle

Modular design is the foundation of scalable systems. Each functional area (EntrancePage, VisitRoom, StudyRoom, ThoughtLens) is separated into its own folder, with both frontend and backend logic, and communicates via shared libraries.

---

## 3. Solution

Structure the entire im1ai.ca platform using isolated modules, each with:

- Independent **frontend React app**
- Dedicated **Node.js backend**
- Specific **README.md** per module
- **iChips** to explain evolving logic
